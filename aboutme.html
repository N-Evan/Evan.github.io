      <div class="content">
        <p>I'm Evan. I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember, this led to me spending time pondering about how it would feel to be able to create 
          such engaging experiences for millions of others to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My very first step towards into game development started during my first of undergraduate studies where I dabbled into Unity Engine and created an old school 
          text-based Create Your Own Adventure-esque game on a small story that I wrote before. Ever since then I followed various indie game developers on multiple platforms 
          to keep up with latest trends in the industry. 
        </p>
        <p>Right before completing my undergraduate degree, I was fortunate enough to secure a job at Brain Station 23 in the Studio 23 team as a trainee gameplay programmer 
          that kick-started my career and further drived me to pursue this to it's highest ends.

          <p>Well, hobbies are a tough one. I pursue almost anything that I find intriguing. Yet, to narrow it down. I play a lot games, both offline and online. Gaming has always been an integral part of my life.</p>
          <p>Spending endless hours trying to find soothing yet relatable and meaningful music takes up a huge chunk of my daily time as well as pondering unique gameplay ideas.</p>
